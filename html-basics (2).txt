Begin with....

1)Start with <!doctype html> all the time. This is to declare what document it is.
2)Then wrap around our html document with <html> and closing with </html> 
3) inside the <html>, there will be <head> </head> and <body> </body>


Head breaks

4) Inside <head></head> there will be a title. <title></title> is where what you can do to name the tabs of what you created.




Body Breaks

5) Inside <body></body>, there will be mutiple things you can add. The <body> is what you can display on the actual website.

6) <h1> </h1> to <h6></h6> is the heading. The higher the number, the smaller the font. This acts as a big ass title for the website.

7) <p> </p> is for paragraphs or to skip a line. 

8)<br> are just skipping lines. Does not need to end with </br>. You can add multiple breaks and don't need to end.

9) <!--   (Insert comment)     --> are invisible comments.

10) to comment in the <br> or spaces, just type underneath that code.

11) &nbsp is for a space between words or letters. Such as skip zero => skip    zero

 12) Unordered List 
<ul>
 <li> (List item) </li>
</ul>
These make lists that look like this: *CD
			      *Magazine
They skip lines after each <li>

13) Ordered are <ol> </ol>. Same as unordered list, but with apropriate numbers.
Such as: 1) CD
              2) Magazine

14) <table> </table> is for creating tables with apropriate lists.
	1) First setup a column with <tr> </tr> 
	2) <th> <th> is the heading of each column
	3) <td> </td> is the data in each column under each heading.
In the end, the code for table looks like this :
		<table>
		<tr>
		<th> (insert column heading) <th>
		<th> (insert column heading) <th>
		</tr>
		      <tr>
		      <td> (Insert data in first column) </td>
		      <td> (Insert data in second column) </td>
		       </tr>
		<tr>
		<td> (1second row of first column) </td>
		<td> (second row of second column) </td>
		</tr>
		</table> 

15) To create or redirect to links: you need to start with a <p></p> or <br>
   <a  href="(url of the link)">  (then type what you want the link name to be ) </a>     This will be a link imbedded in the text. 

16) To create a link that moves the page to the certain spot. This doesn't change the url at all!!
  Link:   Start with Unordered list and then create list elements.
	<ul>
		<li> 	<a href="#(where you want to move the page, such as a word)">(Same word or you want to move it)   </a>  </li>
	</ul>
			# is what connects to similar names and thus hyperlinks to move the page down
			The result of clicking the first is another html cod
   Result: <a name="(where you want to move the page, such as word)" </a> 

17) Adding an image: You first need the image on the same folder as the html code
	You need <br> or <p> </p> first.
	<img src="(name of the image within same folder)">

18) Resizing and sizing images: landscapes or big pictures should use jpeg. Small logos and smaller portraits should use .png or .gif
	You simply alter the image html on top!
So you change <Img src="(name of image)"> to <img src="(name of image)" width="(number)" height="(number)">









	These will all be within the <body></body>   These all needed to begin with code <form action="" method="">
19) To create a one-line text box you first need:
	<form action="" method="">
	and close with </form>
	Inside of that input: <input type="text" name="" size"(how big you want it)">

20) Inorder to create a label for  your text box... You need to modify the text box html.
	So you first create <label for="(label to identify the html)">(Name of the text box):</label>
	then alter the text box html to: <input type="text" id="label to identify the html)" name="">

		Example: <label for="EDWARD">fuuuck my anus:</label>
			<Input type="text" id="EDWARD" name="">
	
	This will create:      fuck my anus:____________________

21) To increase the size of your text box: 
	1) first input the original code for your text box: <form action="" method="">
	2) then input the modification html for that text box: <textarea rows="(number of rows for textbox)" cols="(number of columns)"></textarea>

	Example: <form action=""method="">
		<textarea rows="10" cols="10"></textarea>              will create....
			_____________
			_____________
			_____________
If you want to label the text box you just put the name inbetween the two codes: 
<form action=""method="">
(Comment or label of text box)
<textarea rows="10" cols="10"></textarea>    

22) to create a submit button for your text box: you input the html for it which is..... <input type="submit" value="(text of button)">

	Example: <form action=""method="">
	(Comment or label of text box)</br>
	<textarea rows="10" cols="10"></textarea></br>    
	<Input type="submit" value="(Hi, click me)">
will create.....			___________
				___________	
				___________	[submit]

23) To create button where you can click on... Radio buttons bud..
	<form action="" method="">
	(label for the button) <input type=""radio" name="(random name to identify for buttons)" value=""> <br>
	(label for second button) <input type>=""radio" name="(random name to identify for buttons)" value="">

24) To create checkboxes... Such as boxes in which you can click multiple times: 
	<form action="" method="">
	<input type="checkbox" name=""> (name for check box) <br>
	<input type="checkbox" name="">(name for second checkbox) <br>
<br> is just for formatting or skipping a line down. Not totally necessary, but is useful to making it look legit.
		Example: <form action="" method="">
		What should I do with my life? <br>
		<input type="checkbox" name=""> Kill yourself <br>
		
25) To create a textbox in which you can put a set number amount:
<form action=""method="">
<Input type"number" min="(smallest amount in number box)" max="(highest amount)">
<</form>
	
26) To create a drop-down box... or a textbox with given answers:
 
<form action=""method="">
<select> 
<option value="(answer)">(answerdisplayed)</option>
</select>

You can create as many <option value as you want.

27) To create a textbox which registers a date:
	<input type="date" name="day">
	Number of days: <input type="number" name="numdays" min="(smallest number to input box)" max="(maximum days)">

These are all the child of <form></form> not <form action
 
Example: <form>
		Enter day you want to travel to Cancun
	<input type="date" name="day">
	Number of days: <input type="number" name="numdays" min="1" max="10>
	</form>
		Will create....     Enter day you want to travel to Cancun [  /   /     ]
					Number of Days:_____

honestly, in this case where you register only <form></form>... You can also substitute it for <form action=""method="">

28) Labeled textboxes are children of <form> and just <input type="text">

29) To create a box for all your input elements such as radio buttons and text boxes:
	put <fieldset></fieldset> inside <form>
Example: <form>
	<fieldset> 
	<input type="radio"
	</fieldset>
	</form>

30) To create a caption for <fieldset>:
Use the <legend> for any text
Example: <form>
	<fieldset>
	<legend> How to get girls> </legend>
	<input type="text">
	</fieldset>
	</form>

31) Attributes are always in the opening element
elements or angle brackets are like <p> and <h1>
Attribute examples: <p class="test"> (some words) </p>
The class="test" is the attribute.

Some attributes are different based on the elements. Such as <label> uses attribute for="name"

tm= &#8482
&=&amp
@= &copy
<=&lt

For example: This is a <b> bolded word </b>.

39) 
<b></b>=bold
<strong></strong>= darker than bold
<i></i>= for italics
<em></em>= for more italicer

40) iframe element is just another html document. Inserts content from external pages like advertisement and music:

41) iframe element: <iframe frameborder="(1 or 0") width="(any amount of pixels)" height="(any amount of pixels)" src="(file in the same folder)" name="(give any name to identify)" id="(same as src)"> (some text) </iframe> <br />
	To connect it in same border:
<a href="(name of second html)" target="(same as id on iframe)"> (then some text)</a>

This iframe element is basically a document and when you click on (then some text), it changes to a second html document.
1 means ON. 0 means OFF.
All of these must be on the same folder.

42) To create superscript and subscript element: Such as H20.. The 2 being a subscript.
<sup></sup> is superscript
